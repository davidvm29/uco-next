### AUPA aims to “make a logical, coherent and responsible offer” of degrees and calls for “quality, strategy and equal conditions” with respect to private universities.

The Association of Rectors of Andalusian Public Universities (AUPA) met today at the University of Cádiz to establish criteria from the Andalusian university system in relation to the new map of degrees and to address different priority issues in the field of academic organization such as micro-credits or micro-credentials, master's degrees or European consortia. The session was chaired by the acting rector of the UCA, Francisco Piniella, as host of the meeting, and by the rector of the Pablo de Olavide University, Francisco Oliva, current president of AUPA.

After the initial session of AUPA that opened the morning agenda before the vice-rectors of Academic Organization meet in parallel in three sectors to study the topics planned in the content program, the rectors of the public universities Andalusians has appeared publicly to report on the issues addressed. In the words of the president of AUPA, “we have met fundamentally to analyze how to implement a new decree for the organization of university teaching, which is very important for the Andalusian public university system since the current one was established in 2010 and has not undergone changes. ”

In this context, Francisco Oliva has pointed out, “we are in the process of the 4.0 revolution, the green revolution or equality and many other changes that require an adaptation of our universities. This decree gives new possibilities to do new degrees in Andalusia and what we intend is to make a logical, coherent and responsible offer. “We are a unique public university system and we want to respond in the best way to the training needs of our community.” For this reason, he added, “we do not intend to compete between universities but rather coordinate and make a coherent offer.”

In this sense, the rector of the UPO has indicated that we must work in three areas: “being able to offer joint degrees, promoting the internationalization of universities through the recruitment of foreign students with an attractive offer and long-term training. of a lifetime so that all people throughout their lives continue training at the university through the micro-credential system where the Andalusian universities are already working with the aim of making a competitive, rational and that offers the best possible training to citizens in Andalusia.”

Regarding the creation of private universities, the president of AUPA recalled that the position of the Association of Rectors of Andalusian Public Universities “has been very clear for some time. First of all, we demand that all quality requirements required of any university be strictly met, in addition to competing on equal terms. “The strict requirements to offer a degree do not exist in the private sector.” Furthermore, he has specified the need to have “a general university strategy with respect to private ones, which are fully legal, but demanding quality, strategy and equal conditions.”
