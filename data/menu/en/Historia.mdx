# STORY AND PROMOTIONAL VIDEO

Two centuries of history support the trajectory of the **University of Córdoba**, which, founded as such in 1972, has its roots in the Free University that operated in the province at the end of the 19th century and has centuries-old studies such as those of Veterinary, unique in Andalusia. Its youth and its average size - the **UCO** has 21,000 students; just over 1,200 professors and 700 workers - have given it the necessary dynamism to adapt and enter the 21st century as a University of high teaching quality and proven scientific solvency.

**UCO**'s studies range from Humanities and Legal-Social Sciences to Health Sciences and scientific-technical careers, three areas that correspond to its structure in three large campuses: social legal, integrated in the urban center; the Health one, to the west of the capital, and the agri-food, scientific and technical one of Rabanales, in the eastern area. In addition, the **UCO** has the Belmez Polytechnic School, located sixty kilometers from the capital of Córdoba.

The Rabanales campus constitutes the best proof of the modernization process that characterizes the University. Its facilities accommodate the most advanced infrastructure for research and teaching, while integrating a whole series of complementary services that make it one of the most outstanding teaching complexes in Andalusia. Rabanales concentrates a good part of the scientific production of the University, located at the forefront of research in the Andalusian autonomous community and among the most relevant research institutions at the national level. Both research and teaching are understood at the **University of Córdoba** as the two great pillars of the institution, always with the same goal: quality. Added to this objective is the leading role that the UCO is playing in the development of the **European Higher Education Area**. Teaching, Research, Quality and Europe are, therefore, the maxims that currently govern the life of the University.
