### In the latest edition of the ranking, the UCO improves its classification, going from 772nd to 744th. At the national level it is ranked 16th and continues to be second in Andalusia.

The University of Córdoba maintains its position among the 800 best universities in the world, according to the latest edition of [THE Ranking (Times Higher Education World University Ranking)](). The UCO, although it continues in the range of the 600-801 best universities, improves its ranking and goes from 772 to 744, rising 28 positions. At the national level, the University of Córdoba is ranked 16th out of 60 Spanish universities. It continues to be the second in Andalusia.

The THE Ranking, one of the most prestigious internationally, lists a total of 1,904 universities from 108 countries and measures, through 18 indicators, the learning environment, the research environment, the quality of research, the international perspective and the industry. These 5 groups of indicators define, through surveys, data captured from universities and scientific information providers such as Scopus, the set of aspects that best define, according to their methodology, the common characteristics of the world's universities.

At a global level, the UCO rises positions in this post-covid era where research work seriously suffered from the pandemic.

This positioning is due to the growth, in general, of the aforementioned indicators, increasing scores in four of the five analyzed and going from a final score of 34.34 in the 2023 ranking to 38.11 in this last 2024 ranking (11% ).
